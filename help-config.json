      "question": "How does Hiring Assistant work",
      "answer": "Sales Navigator's AI-powered Hiring Assistant is a tool designed to enhance the efficiency of prospecting by delivering pre-screened leads, identifying optimal paths to connect with prospects, and drafting personalized outreach messages. To maximize the effectiveness of Hiring Assistant, here's how it works and some tips to optimize its key features:\n\n**Lead Recommendation and Feedback:**\n· Hiring Assistant provides recommendations for leads based on your preferences, including your selected book of business, products, and personas.\n· Reviewing leads and providing feedback (e.g., marking a lead as \"Not a fit\" with specific reasons such as incorrect geography, seniority, or industry) helps Hiring Assistant refine future recommendations to align with your needs.\n\n**Personalized Messaging Assistance:**\n· Using Message Assist, Hiring Assistant drafts personalized first-touch messages by leveraging account insights, lead data, and customization based on your product details and messaging preferences.\n· You can refine these drafts, and Hiring Assistant learns from your edits to improve future message drafts automatically.\n\n**Product and Service Personalization:**\n· You can specify the product or service you're selling, ensuring that generated messages and lead recommendations are tailored to showcase how your offering solves a lead's needs.\n· Adding detailed product descriptions enhances personalization and improves how prospects are targeted.\n\n**Book of Business:**\n· Designating an \"account list\" in your book of business helps target relevant accounts. Lists should include at least five accounts to be actively used by Hiring Assistant.\n· To populate your book of business, you can use auto-saved CRM accounts, upload a CSV file, or manually create an account list."

      "question": "Where to see leads from Hiring Assistant",
      "answer": "To see leads from Hiring Assistant in Sales Navigator, follow these steps:\n\n**1. Navigate to the Prospecting Tab:**\n· Click on the \"Prospecting\" option in the top menu.\n\n**2. Review the Recommended Leads:**\n· In the \"Prospecting\" tab, the left pane will display leads recommended by Hiring Assistant.\n· Each recommended lead includes details on why it was selected, such as alignment with your lead preferences, account list, or personas. This helps you understand the recommendation's relevance.\n\n**3. Interact with Leads:**\n· Select a specific lead from the left pane to view its details.\n· To confirm if the lead recommendation is suitable for you:\n  · Click \"Good fit\" to approve the lead. Approved leads are saved automatically to your \"Leads from Hiring Assistant\" list for future tracking.\n  · Click \"Not a fit\" to reject the lead. You will be prompted to provide feedback on why the lead does not meet your needs, which allows the Hiring Assistant to refine future recommendations.\n\n**4. First-Touch Messaging:**\n· If you mark a lead as a \"Good fit,\" Hiring Assistant will automatically draft a personalized first-touch message. You can:\n  · Edit the draft before sending.\n  · Copy the message to send through another medium (e.g., email).\n  · Save it for later use.\n\n**5. Generate More Leads:**\n· If you want to explore additional leads beyond the initial batch:\n  · Click \"Generate leads\" in the left pane. This action provides new recommendations; however, you must review the existing batch before accessing more leads.\n  · Keep in mind that there is a daily limit for generating new lead suggestions.\n\nBy following these steps, you can efficiently access and manage the leads recommended by Hiring Assistant to optimize your prospecting process."
