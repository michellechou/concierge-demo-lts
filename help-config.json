      "question": "How does Sales Assistant work",
      "answer": "Sales Navigator's AI-powered Sales Assistant is a tool designed to enhance the efficiency of prospecting by delivering pre-screened leads, identifying optimal paths to connect with prospects, and drafting personalized outreach messages. To maximize the effectiveness of Sales Assistant, here’s how it works and some tips to optimize its key features:\n\n· **Lead Recommendation and Feedback:**\n· Sales Assistant provides recommendations for leads based on your preferences, including your selected book of business, products, and personas.\n· Reviewing leads and providing feedback (e.g., marking a lead as \"Not a fit\" with specific reasons such as incorrect geography, seniority, or industry) helps Sales Assistant refine future recommendations to align with your needs.\n\n· **Personalized Messaging Assistance:**\n· Using Message Assist, Sales Assistant drafts personalized first-touch messages by leveraging account insights, lead data, and customization based on your product details and messaging preferences.\n· You can refine these drafts, and Sales Assistant learns from your edits to improve future message drafts automatically.\n\n· **Product and Service Personalization:**\n· You can specify the product or service you’re selling, ensuring that generated messages and lead recommendations are tailored to showcase how your offering solves a lead's needs.\n· Adding detailed product descriptions enhances personalization and improves how prospects are targeted.\n\n· **Book of Business:**\n· Designating an \"account list\" in your book of business helps target relevant accounts. Lists should include at least five accounts to be actively used by Sales Assistant.\n· To populate your book of business, you can use auto-saved CRM accounts, upload a CSV file, or manually create an account list."
